# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX - TIMESTAMP: 2024-12-19 22:48

## CRITICAL ISSUE
Vercel is still using old commit `bf02f03` instead of latest commit `893f838` with all fixes.

## LATEST COMMIT WITH FIXES
- `893f838` - Fix all build errors and ESLint issues - build now passes successfully
- `9d15cc1` - CRITICAL: Force Vercel to use latest commit with all fixes
- `169f50d` - Update version to 0.1.3 - force latest commit deployment

## PROBLEM
Vercel is using old commit `bf02f03` which has:
- ❌ `useSupabaseUser` import (file doesn't exist)
- ❌ Old package version 0.1.1
- ❌ Broken dashboard page

## SOLUTION
This file was created to force Vercel to use the latest commit with all fixes.

## EXPECTED RESULT
- ✅ Vercel should use latest commit `893f838`
- ✅ Build should succeed without module errors
- ✅ Dashboard should work with `useSession`
