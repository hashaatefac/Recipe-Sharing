# Vercel Deployment Trigger

This file was created to force Vercel to use the latest commit and deploy the corrected layout file.

## Changes Made:
- Removed `testSupabaseConnection` export from layout.tsx
- Removed unused imports from page.tsx
- Fixed TypeScript errors for Next.js layout

## Current Commit: fa9f74f

This deployment should now work without the TypeScript errors.
