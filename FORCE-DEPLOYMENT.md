# FORCE DEPLOYMENT - TIMESTAMP: 2024-12-19 21:47

## CRITICAL ISSUE
Vercel is stuck on commit `bf02f03` and won't pick up our latest commits.

## LATEST COMMITS WITH FIXES
- `169f50d` - Update version to 0.1.3
- `e04693c` - Force Vercel deployment with latest commit a6a4dba  
- `a6a4dba` - Force Vercel to use latest commit with dashboard fix
- `3627f36` - Fix dashboard page: Replace useSupabaseUser with useSession

## PROBLEM
Vercel is still using old commit `bf02f03` which has:
- ❌ `useSupabaseUser` import (file doesn't exist)
- ❌ Old package version 0.1.1
- ❌ Broken dashboard page

## SOLUTION
This file was created to force Vercel to use the latest commit with all fixes.

## EXPECTED RESULT
- ✅ Vercel should use latest commit `169f50d`
- ✅ Build should succeed without module errors
- ✅ Dashboard should work with `useSession`
