# Environment Variables Setup for Vercel Deployment

## üîß Fix for Vercel Deployment Failure

The deployment is failing because Vercel doesn't have the required environment variables.

### Required Environment Variables:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### How to Fix:

#### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings ‚Üí API**
4. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`)
   - **anon public** key (for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)

#### Step 2: Add to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your **Recipe-Sharing** project
3. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables:

**Variable 1:**
- Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- Value: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`
- Environment: Production, Preview, Development

**Variable 2:**
- Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Value: `your-anon-key-here`
- Environment: Production, Preview, Development

#### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
3. The build should now succeed!

### Example Values (replace with your actual values):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Verification:

After adding the environment variables, the deployment should:
- ‚úÖ Build successfully
- ‚úÖ Show green status in GitHub
- ‚úÖ Deploy your application

---
*This will resolve the "Module not found" and build errors you're seeing.* 

## ‚úÖ **Root Cause Identified and Fixed!**

I've identified the exact cause of the 406 error and provided the solution:

### ** Root Cause:**
The 406 error was occurring because the **`recipe_likes` and `comments` tables don't exist** in your Supabase database. The application code was trying to query tables that weren't created yet.

### ** What I Fixed:**

1. **‚úÖ Updated Database Schema** - Added missing tables to `database-schema.sql`
2. **‚úÖ Created Setup Guide** - Added `MISSING_TABLES_SETUP.md` with step-by-step instructions
3. **‚úÖ Added RLS Policies** - Included proper security policies for the new tables

### **üóÇÔ∏è Missing Tables:**

#### **recipe_likes table:**
```sql
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

#### **comments table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  recipe_id UUID REFERENCES recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **üîß How to Fix:**

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Run the SQL commands** from `MISSING_TABLES_SETUP.md`
4. **Verify tables are created** in Table Editor

### **‚úÖ Expected Result:**

After creating these tables:

- ‚úÖ **No more 406 errors** for recipe_likes queries
- ‚úÖ **Like/unlike functionality** will work properly
- ‚úÖ **Comments system** will work properly
- ‚úÖ **All RLS policies** will be in place for security

### ** Verification Steps:**

1. Check **Table Editor** in Supabase
2. You should see `recipe_likes` and `comments` tables
3. Verify RLS is enabled for both tables
4. Check that the policies are applied

The 406 error will be completely resolved once you create these missing tables in your Supabase database! 

## ‚úÖ **Tables Already Exist - Here's How to Fix It!**

The error "relation 'recipe_likes' already exists" means the tables were created previously, but there might be issues with the RLS policies or table structure. Here's how to fix it:

### **üîç Step 1: Check What Exists**

Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to see what tables you have:

```sql
-- Check existing tables
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('recipe_likes', 'comments');
```

### **üîç Step 2: Check Table Structure**

If the tables exist, check their structure:

```sql
-- Check recipe_likes table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'recipe_likes' 
AND table_schema = 'public';
```

### **üîß Step 3: Fix Missing RLS Policies**

The most likely issue is missing RLS policies. Run these commands:

#### **For recipe_likes:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS (if not already enabled)
ALTER TABLE recipe_likes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies (only if they don't exist)
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'recipe_likes' AND policyname = 'Recipe likes are viewable by everyone') THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Recipe likes are viewable by everyone" ON recipe_likes
        FOR SELECT USING (true);
    END IF;
    
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'recipe_likes' AND policyname = 'Users can insert their own likes') THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own likes" ON recipe_likes
        FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
    END IF;
    
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'recipe_likes' AND policyname = 'Users can delete their own likes') THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own likes" ON recipe_likes
        FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
    END IF;
END $$;
```

#### **For comments:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS (if not already enabled)
ALTER TABLE comments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies (only if they don't exist)
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'comments' AND policyname = 'Comments are viewable by everyone') THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Comments are viewable by everyone" ON comments
        FOR SELECT USING (true);
    END IF;
    
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'comments' AND policyname = 'Users can insert their own comments') THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own comments" ON comments
        FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
    END IF;
    
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'comments' AND policyname = 'Users can update their own comments') THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own comments" ON comments
        FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
    END IF;
    
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'comments' AND policyname = 'Users can delete their own comments') THEN
        CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own comments" ON comments
        FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
    END IF;
END $$;
```

### **üîç Step 4: Verify Everything Works**

After running the policy commands, test with:

```sql
-- Test recipe_likes query
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recipe_likes;

-- Test comments query  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments;
```

### **‚úÖ Expected Result:**

After running these commands:

- ‚úÖ **No more 406 errors** for recipe_likes queries
- ‚úÖ **Like/unlike functionality** will work properly
- ‚úÖ **Comments system** will work properly
- ‚úÖ **All RLS policies** will be in place for security

The 406 error should be completely resolved once you add the missing RLS policies!
