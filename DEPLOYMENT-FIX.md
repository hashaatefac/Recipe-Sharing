# DEPLOYMENT FIX

## Issue
Vercel is using commit `bf02f03` instead of the latest commit `a6a4dba` which has the dashboard fix.

## Current Status
- **Latest Commit**: `a6a4dba` (has dashboard fix)
- **Vercel Using**: `bf02f03` (old commit with errors)
- **Problem**: Module not found: '../hooks/useSupabaseUser'

## Fix Applied
- Replaced `useSupabaseUser` with `useSession` in dashboard page
- Updated all authentication to use new SessionProvider
- Removed old hook references

## Expected Result
- Vercel should use commit `a6a4dba`
- Build should succeed without module resolution errors
- Dashboard page should work correctly
